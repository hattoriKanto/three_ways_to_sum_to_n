# Three ways to sum to n

This repository demonstrates three different methods to calculate the sum of integers from 0 to n.

## The approaches include:

**Iteration:** A simple and straightforward method using a for loop. Best for beginners, but may face performance issues with large input sizes.

**Recursion:** A more complex approach that leverages the power of recursion. It is elegant but comes with the risk of stack overflow if not handled carefully.

**Mathematical Formula:** The most optimized method using the arithmetic series formula, requiring no loops or recursion. While it is efficient, it may be harder to understand at first glance.
